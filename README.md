Design patterns are common architectural approaches. They were popularized by the Gang of Four book (1994) for Smalltalk and C++.

## Gamma Categorization

They are typically split into three categories. This is called *Gamma Categorization* after Erich Gamma, one of the Gang of Four book authors â€”

### Creational Patterns

- These deal with the creation of objects.
- Explicit vs. Implicit: Constructor vs. [Dependency Injection, reflection, ...].
- Wholesale vs. piecewise initialization.

### Structural Patterns

- These are concerned with the structure (e.g., class members).
- Many patterns are wrapers that mimic the underlying class interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design. **Make API usable for other people**.

### Behavioral Patterns

- They are all different; no central theme.
- They solve specific problems that frequently occur in software design.
